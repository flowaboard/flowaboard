  Flowaborad is knowledge dependency framework with inbuilt power to develop, test ,dedupe and simulate any knowledge.To flow abaord any knowledge we need to think flowly.

  What is like to think flowly? 
  
  Just think what you have , what you want and how will you have it. Whenever we want something of physical existence we represent them using some abstract entities like maths,physics,program or business. 

  Every abstract entity we define is part or builidng blocks of some bigger structure, design or architecture. Representing them using some single theory or infrastructure seems to be one of  humankind goal to solve mysteries of universe as well as meet the end needs. Well who knows why maths, physics or artificial intelligence or any abstract entity to represent physical existences was ever dscovered or invented. But for sure they always somehow extract,produces or achieve what we want from what we have.

  Unfortunately if this abstract entities aren't collected, modified and rediscovered in some structured application there might be lot of redudant rediscoveries which we would like to avoid. There is always a question which needs to be answered, what we have learned and how much of we are using it.
