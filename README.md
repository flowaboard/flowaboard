  Flowaborad is a graphical language platform which allows us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design">design</a>, develop, test and simulate any prototype, product, or process. Anything we can imagine which has an order of execution can be imagined & visualized flowly.

  ***What is like to imagine flowly?***
  >Just think what you have, what you want and how will you have it. 

  ***What do we mean by visualize flowly?***
  >Graphical representation of a prototype, product or proceess with moving elements flowing in and out of still elements and presenting a dynamic visual representaion.
